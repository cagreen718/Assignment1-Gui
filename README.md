First Assignment for GUI CSPC 3118
Carnell Greenfield III and Assignment 1
• I used Moqup.
• Comments on Image 1 – The best feature is the more interactive Interface for users but is missing a pay slot.
• Comments on Image 2 - I added the slot in this design and a way for the user to pay. The user has less of an interactable interface.
My favorite feature is the slot for the dispenser.
